                    <div class="acc_content clearfix">

                    <div class="acc_content clearfix">As the tagline for mobitrash suggests, it is ‘composting on wheels’ service. We shall only accept segregated organic (bio degradable) waste for treatment and transport.</div>

                        For households, yes. A maximum of 0.5 kg of garbage per day per household can be given for treatment in mobitrash.</div>

                    <div class="acc_content clearfix">
                        No. The segregated organic waste has to be brought to the mobitrash van in large plastic containers for treatment.</div>

                    <div class="acc_content clearfix">
                    As a rule of thumb, 100 kg of organic waste is treated in 30-45 minutes.</div>

                    <div class="acc_content clearfix">
                    There could be few days in a year when the mobitrash van would need some maintainence breaks. Still, it is our responsibility to ensure the waste is carted away from your premises in a timely manner.</div>

                    <div class="acc_content clearfix">
                    It is very simple! You need to sign up for the service on our website www.mobitrash.in. One of us will call you to set up an appointment with you fairly soon. We shall set up a free trial for a month. Mid-way during the trial period, we shall enter into a longer term commercial agreement with you.</div>
